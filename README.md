Project Description

SilentSync is a Malayalam Speech-to-Sign Language web application that converts spoken Malayalam into text and displays corresponding sign language visuals in real-time. It aims to bridge communication between hearing individuals and the deaf community through accessible technology.

The Problem statement

Spoken communication is not accessible to individuals who rely on sign language. In everyday interactions, there is often a communication gap between hearing individuals and the deaf community, especially in spontaneous conversations.

The Solution

SilentSync uses the Web Speech API to capture Malayalam speech, convert it into text, and dynamically map recognized words to sign language images. This creates a simple, real-time visual representation of spoken communication, improving accessibility and inclusivity.

Project Demo 


What the Video Demonstrates :
The demo video showcases SilentSync in action — a real-time Malayalam Speech-to-Sign Language conversion system.
It highlights how spoken Malayalam is captured, processed, and transformed into corresponding sign language visuals within the browser.

Key Features Shown :
Real-time Malayalam speech recognition using Web Speech API
Instant speech-to-text conversion
Word-based sign language mapping logic
Dynamic rendering of corresponding sign images
Clean, accessible, and structured user interface
Fast client-side processing (no backend required)

User Flow Demonstrated :
The user opens the SilentSync web application.
The user clicks the “Start Speaking” button.
The system activates the microphone and begins listening.
Malayalam speech is captured and converted into text.
Recognized text is displayed on the screen.
The system checks for matching keywords in the predefined wordMap.
Corresponding sign language images appear dynamically.
If multiple recognized words are mapped, multiple signs are displayed.
This demonstrates seamless real-time interaction from voice input to visual output.

Technical Highlights :
Uses the browser’s Web Speech API for Malayalam speech recognition.
Implements client-side text cleaning and processing.
Uses a word mapping object (wordMap) to match recognized words.
Dynamically renders sign images using React’s state-based UI updates.
Fully frontend-based architecture — no backend dependency.
Lightweight, fast, and easily deployable.
