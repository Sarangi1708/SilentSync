### Hosted Project Link
[Add your deployed link here – e.g., Vercel/Netlify URL]

### Project Description
SilentSync is a Malayalam Speech-to-Sign Language web application that bridges spoken communication and visual sign language. It converts Malayalam speech into text and displays corresponding sign language visuals in real-time.

### The Problem Statement
Communication barriers exist between hearing individuals and the deaf community. Spoken conversations are not accessible to everyone, especially in everyday interactions.

### The Solution
SilentSync listens to Malayalam speech using the Web Speech API, converts it into text, and dynamically maps recognized words to sign language images — creating a simple, real-time accessibility bridge.
