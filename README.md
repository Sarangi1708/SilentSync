Project Description

SilentSync is a Malayalam Speech-to-Sign Language web application that converts spoken Malayalam into text and displays corresponding sign language visuals in real-time. It aims to bridge communication between hearing individuals and the deaf community through accessible technology.

The Problem statement

Spoken communication is not accessible to individuals who rely on sign language. In everyday interactions, there is often a communication gap between hearing individuals and the deaf community, especially in spontaneous conversations.

The Solution

SilentSync uses the Web Speech API to capture Malayalam speech, convert it into text, and dynamically map recognized words to sign language images. This creates a simple, real-time visual representation of spoken communication, improving accessibility and inclusivity.
